# ðŸ“± Effie - Cross-Platform Chat App Frontend (Capstone Project)

Welcome to **Effie**, a mobile application built using **React Native with the Expo bare workflow**. Effie enables users to securely sign in and interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by DataSpeckle. This project was developed over a 4-month capstone period using agile methodologies.

## Project Overview

Efie provides a clean, user-friendly mobile interface where users can:

- Sign in using **Google** or **Apple** (OAuth2.0)
- Send and receive messages to/from an AI-driven LLM
- View conversation history
- Store tokens and user information securely using Expo Secure Store
- Integrate seamlessly with a FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL database

This frontend was developed using **React Native + Expo bare workflow** to enable deep native customizations while leveraging the productivity of Expo modules.

## Project Goals

- Deliver a fully functional frontend app with cross-platform support (iOS and Android)
- Build a scalable authentication flow using native SDKs and OAuth2
- Provide a smooth and engaging UX for real-time AI chat interactions
